## REACH Pipeline FTP File processing 
 
#### Requirements
You will have to mount the JAR file generated by [CLULAB/REACH](https://github.com/clulab/reach) to `/src/reach.jar`  
Also you will have to mount the output folder to `/src/reach`, this folder should have file `./output/restart.log`, this file will  prevent the NLP processor to process those files which have been done already.

#### Notes
`MACHINE_ID` indicates which file is to be processed according to the following table

| MACHINE_ID | File Name        |
|------------|------------------|
| 0          | non_comm_use.A-B |
| 1          | non_comm_use.O-Z |
| 2          | non_comm_use.C-H |
| 3          | non_comm_use.I-N |
| 4          | comm_use.A-B     |
| 5          | comm_use.C-H     |
| 6          | comm_use.I-N     |
| 7          | comm_use.O-Z     |
